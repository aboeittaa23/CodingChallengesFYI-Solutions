# Coding Challenges Solutions

This repository contains my C++ solutions to the coding challenges from [codingchallenges.fyi](https://codingchallenges.fyi). The goal of this repo is to improve my C++ skills and practice building real world tools and utilities.

## Running the Code

Each challenge directory contains a `Makefile`. To build and run:

```bash
cd challenges/wc-tool/
make                    # Build the project
./ccwc test.txt         # Run the tool
make clean              # Clean build files
```
